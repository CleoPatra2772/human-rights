The history of human rights, from the [Magna Carta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta) to the Enlightenment and beyond, has been tumultuous and complex. Progressive thinkers of each era of human civilization have attempted to record the specifics of human rights, but these documents are scattered around and can conflict with each other. This project was started in late 2022 to serve as a single source of truth for all human rights.

Human rights exist to serve each of us, and so this list is [open source](https://github.com/sean-reid/human-rights); all are encouraged to contribute.
